Wacking Wood!

A low poly game we worked hard on.By Joshua Snook, Jack Lee, Adam Jeziorski, and Arkadiusz Binkowski.
It was done as a part of our Univeristy of Derby Team Project.





Features:


Tree Hit and Slicing Mechanics - Small Minigame to cut down the tree and slice it up.

Sync'd Animations for axe and chainsaw - Animations are timed to the object hitting the tree.

User Interface - Allows the player to see important information.

Save File system - Saves the player's progress and allows them to resume a game.

Endless Procedural Trees Positions and Types, Mesh, Buildings Type, and Position Gen -

The player can walk forever and new terrain is generated around them and populated with buildings and trees.

Day and Night cycle - This creates a better experience and provides a reason for the player to sleep with it affecting stamina.

Mobile Log Storage - Easily allows the logs to be transported to a Selling Point.

Custom Models - All models within the game are made by Adam and Arkadiusz.

Custom Character Controller Script - Provides the ability to move, and look all while being easily changeable.

Custom Interaction and Hitting System - Uses interfaces to allow for the easy creation of Interactable and Hittable Objects.

Main Menu - Allows the player to customize settings and choose to load a game or start a new one.

Independent Buy and Sell Shops - Encourages the players to explore the world more.

Both Axe and Chainsaw tools - To allow for the player to progress and buy fuel to allow for trees to be cut down faster.

Ability to Carry Logs - Allows for the early game transportation of logs.

Skip Time by Sleeping at Camp - Give the player the choice to skip the night and the effects of night as well.



Experimental Features:
Mesh Slicing - Something Jack made but we didn't have time to implement it into the game.
